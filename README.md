# Expo Image Component URI Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Expo's Image component with a URI that does not load correctly, resulting in a blank space or other unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the solution. This issue is often caused by incorrect URIs, server-side problems, or network connectivity issues.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe the missing image in `bug.js` and the successfully loaded image in `bugSolution.js`

## Solution

The solution involves thorough URI validation, proper error handling, and potentially using a fallback image.
